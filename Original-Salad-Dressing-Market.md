Consumers are increasingly looking for transparency in ingredient sourcing and production processes. The rise of influencer culture and social media also plays a crucial role in driving demand for trendy or "Instagram-worthy" food products, including salad dressings.</p><p>Brands are tapping into this trend by offering visually appealing dressings and collaborating with food influencers to create buzz around new products.
